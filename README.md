# EARTH_QUAKE_PREDICTION
About Dataset

Datasets contain records of 782 earthquakes from 1/1/2001 to 1/1/2023. The meaning of all columns is as follows:

title: title name given to the earthquake

magnitude: The magnitude of the earthquake

date_time: date and time

cdi: The maximum reported intensity for the event range

mmi: The maximum estimated instrumental intensity for the event

alert: The alert level - “green”, “yellow”, “orange”, and “red”

tsunami: "1" for events in oceanic regions and "0" otherwise

sig: A number describing how significant the event is. Larger numbers indicate a more significant event. This value is determined on a number of factors, including: magnitude, maximum MMI, felt reports, and estimated impact

net: The ID of a data contributor. Identifies the network considered to be the preferred source of information for this event.

nst: The total number of seismic stations used to determine earthquake location.

dmin: Horizontal distance from the epicenter to the nearest station

gap: The largest azimuthal gap between azimuthally adjacent stations (in degrees). In general, the smaller this number, the more reliable is the calculated horizontal position of the earthquake. Earthquake locations in which the azimuthal gap exceeds 180 degrees typically have large location and depth uncertainties

magType: The method or algorithm used to calculate the preferred magnitude for the event

depth: The depth where the earthquake begins to rupture

latitude / longitude: coordinate system by means of which the position or location of any place on Earth's surface can be determined and described

location: location within the country

continent: continent of the earthquake hit country

country: affected country
